Hello everyone,

This Git repository contains all the work I completed during my internship at CertifyO.

During my time at CertifyO, I worked as a technical trainer, creating JavaScript content for their YouTube channel. I developed interactive lessons and several exciting projects to help teach others.

The code for all these projects is included in this repository.  
A list of all topics covered can be found in `Topics.txt`.

Thank you!
