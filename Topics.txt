Lecture 4
functions, arsrow function (hoisted and not hoisted)
functions expression
return, special arrow function implementation
try and catch block

Lecture 5
Stings in javascript, template literals
Common useful string methods

Problems ->  Palindrome(ex: madam, racecar),  
Check that reads the same forward and backward.
Masking Email Address -> Given an email address as a string, write a function that
masks the username portion of the email while keeping the domain intact. 
The function should replace all but the first and last character of the username with asterisks (*).
If the username is very short (2 characters or fewer), return the email as is.
"john.doe@example.com" Example Output: "j******e@example.com" Example Input: "ab@example.com" Example Output: "ab@example.com"

Lecture 10 - Question Solving

1)Write a function in JavaScript that removes all vowels (a, e, i, o, u) from a given string. 
The function should return a new string containing only the consonants.
The function should be case-insensitive (i.e., remove both uppercase and lowercase vowels).

ðŸ”¹Example Input: "Hello World"
ðŸ”¹Expected Output: "Hll Wrld"

2)Create a JavaScript function that takes a string and returns a new string containing only the unique characters from the input â€” 
in the order they first appear.
Duplicate characters should be removed.

ðŸ”¹Example Input: "programming"
ðŸ”¹Expected Output: "progamin"

3)Implement a custom function miniArrayFrom() that mimics the behavior of JavaScriptâ€™s built-in Array.from() method. 
The function should convert array-like or iterable objects into an actual array.

4)Write a JavaScript program that takes an array of user objects and formats each user's data into a well-structured console output.
